## üì• **Loading Pretrained Models**

You need to load the pretrained models into your `trained_models` directory, they can be found gs:
//actin-personalization-models-v1/trained_models/

## üõ† Python Environment Setup

To ensure that the code runs as intended, set up your Python environment with the required dependencies. This repository uses a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies. Run the following command in the root directory of the repository:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the packages required to run the project.
