## üöÄ **Workflow**

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   Use the `data_processing.py` script to preprocess and split survival data.

2. **Model Training**:  
   Train models using the `train_and_evaluate` method in the `ModelTrainer` class.

3. **Feature Selection**:  
   Perform feature selection for CoxPH and Aalen Additive models.

4. **Evaluation and Visualization**:
    - Evaluate models using metrics like C-Index, IBS, CE, and AUC.
    - Visualize survival curves and compare model performance.

5. **Model Interpretation**:  
   Use SHAP to interpret the trained models.

## üì• **Loading Pretrained Models**

You need to load the pretrained models into your `trained_models` directory, they can be found gs:
//actin-personalization-models-v1/trained_models/

## üõ† Python Environment Setup

To ensure that the code runs as intended, set up your Python environment with the required dependencies. This repository uses a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies. Run the following command in the root directory of the repository:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the packages required to run the project.
